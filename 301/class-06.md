6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
Greater efficiency, engaged collaboration, learning from fellow students, social skills, job interview readiness, and work enviroment readiness are the 6 reasons for pair programming accoring to the Code Fellows post.

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
I feel as though my most beneficial has been learning from other students. Seeing other peoples approaches to certain tasks has been eye opening. There have been a couple of times where I've learned some things from others. There's also times when I've been able to provide new information to other students. I enjoy the process of learning from each other. I also liked the moments when we both learned something together from mistakes we made.

3. How does pair programming work?
In pair programming there is a driver and a navigator. It's best to switch off so that neither team member gets too exhausted doing the same thing. The driver typically types up all the input for the project and is responsible for clicking their way through everything as well. The navigator provides directions for the driver. Telling them where to go but not actually entering anything into the system. It's almost like a rally car team where the driver has his navigator directing him to make the right moves.
