# Class 7 Notes

## How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
He is one of the the creators of the first web servers who has done extensive research on how the web works.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
Because a lot of developers didn't use techniques that would allow every machine to talk with another. Only certain groups of machines were made able to interact with each other.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
It's applying verbs to nouns and the goal was to make it universal so that all machines could have one common language.

4. What does a GET do?
It fetches something that has been requested.

5. What does a POST do?
Adds something to another system

6. What does PUT do?
Replaces something in another system

7. What does PATCH do?
Only updates a part of something
