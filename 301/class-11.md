# Class 11 Notes

1. Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
SQL- Called Relational Databases/table based datatypes/predefined schema/vertically scalable/use structured query language.
NoSQL- Called non-relational or distributed database/ document based, key value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores/no dynamic schema for unstructured data/horizontally scalable/unstructured query language.

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
For complex query intensive environments

3. Give a real world example.
Oracle

4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Hierarchal data stroage and large data set.

5. Give a real world example.
JSON Data

6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL
7. Which type of database is best for scalability?
NoSQL seems like the better choice as it can do noth vertical and horizontal scaling. SQL is limited to vertical scaling and that imposes a limit on it.

sql vs nosql

1. What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language

2. What is a relational database?
It works with certain assumptions and provides access to data that is related

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
Tables

4. What is a ‘schema’?
A certain set of rules. All records in a table have to conform to a schema.

5. What is a NoSQL database?
A database that stores differently than relational databases. They have flexible schemas and are good with large data amounts.

6. How does it work?
It has no schemas and little to no relations. 

7. What is inside of a MongoDB database?
A lot of data. It has a bunch of collections and documents.

8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
MongoDb is more flexible because there is not a need for schemas.

9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
If you have multiple write requests thta need to be updated often will be a disadvantage and would be something that would be better fit for SQL.
