## Speed Coding: Building a CRUD API

1. Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?
We are able to use CRUD via the protocols layed down by REST
2. If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
First a URL must be identified so we know what interface we'll be using. Next we will build out the connection between server and client. The client must then make a request and make sure to include all necessary information. Store that data in a cache. Make that data available to the client the next time around.
