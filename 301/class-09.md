## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?
According to the article it is a programming paradigm. It is a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs. It treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. 

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
A pure function is one that would yield the same results if it's given the same arguments. We know if a function is pure if it adheres to the statement above.

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
It doesn't cause any observable side effects and it is easier to test than unpure functions.

4. What is immutability?
It is when data is unable to be changed. It would require creating an entirely new piece of data.

5. What is Referential transparency?
It is when a function keeps getting the same result after being given the same input.
