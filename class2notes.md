## Class 2 Notes

There are standard text editors that come built into your computer that have the least amount of features such as “Text Edit” and “Notepad”. 

There are third party text editors that have more features than a text editor and these include Notepad++, Text Wrangler, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text. These may include features such as code completion which saves time and reduces chance for errors. Syntax highlighting which makes text easier to read and allows us to identify errors quicker. A variety of themes that can reduce eye strain and fatigue. They may also have the ability to choose from a selection of extensions which are tools to help you accomplish more with less effort.

Then there are IDEs or Integrated Development Environment which is a bunch of different software all coming together. An IDE can do text editing, file managing, compilation, and debugging. This is more advanced and not everyone will have a need for all the features it offers.
The important thing to remember when choosing a text editor is to choose the one that works best for your individual needs.
