# Class 17 Notes

This topic is important because we need to know how to secure our applications so that no one is able to gain access to them and do malicious things to them.

There are samples implemented through Spring Boot and they are:

- Simple refers to a very basic static app with only a home page and unconditional login through Spring Boots AuthO config properties
- Click adds a link for the user to use to login
- Logout adds a logout link for authenticated users
- Two-providers adds a second login provider and gives the user the option of which one they would like to use
- Custom-error adds an error message for unathenticated users 
- Spring security is used to secure applications
- All sample apps are able to be extended and re-configured for more specific use cases
