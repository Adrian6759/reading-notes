1. What does “strong typed” mean?
Strong typed means that there is no way a user can work around rules that apply to a certain language. When a language is strong typed it means it has these restictions.

2. Explain to a non-technical friend the difference in how compilation works in Java and JavaScript.
Java converts its language(what we write) into language that the computer is able to understand. Once that is done, a vitrual machine then runs what it's supposed to based off of the computer receives. Javascript does not reauire a compiler to run its code. Javascript is instead interpreted by a browser interpeter.
