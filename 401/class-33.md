# Class 33 Reading Notes

Describe asynchronous actions in your own words.
Asynchronous actions are actions that we need to wait for in order for them to be processed. This wait can sometimes be a long time and can sometimes negatively impact our code as a whole.

What is the benefit of asynchronous methods?
Using asynchronous methods allows us to wait for those methods and stop everything until they do what they are supposed to. By doing that we allow our application to run the way we intend it to. We can trigger actions at times when they're supposed to be triggered so that other bits of code aren't negatively affected.
