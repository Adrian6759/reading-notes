# Class Notes 8

## Don’t Repeat Yourself but consider the Rule of Three

- Keeping code dry is important. It avoids redundancy and makes the code more efficient.

- The rule of three is a rule of thumb for refactoring. It gives you three strikes. After the third strike, you need to refactor your code. A strike would be every instance where your code is similar.

- Having the same code duplicated makes the code harder to maintain.

## You Aren’t Gonna Need It and Minimum Viable Product

- You aren't gonna need it is a principle in programming where you shouldn't add something to the code until that code is
needed.
- Minimum viable product is the very least amount of features that can be added so that the user is able to use it. 
- The user will give the programmers an idea of what needs to be done to the application and avoids wasting time on unnecessary features.
- It gives potential investors the ability to gauge whether or not the porject is worth investing in.
- Helps reduce wasted resources such as money and manpower.
