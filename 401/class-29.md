# Class 29 Reading Notes

What database engine is Room wrapped around? Do you think this is a good choice? Why or why not?
It is wrapped around the SQLite database. This is a good choie because it provides these three benefits according to the developer.android documentation: compile-time verification of SQL queries, convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code, and streamlined database migration paths.

Do Rooms have any similarities to JPA?
They both allow data to persist. They are also both relational databases.

Describe a DAO in your own words
Data access objects are pretty much objects that supply you with methods that allow you to perform CRUD. They allow you to interact witha database in almost the same way by allowwing you to query, update, insert and delete data.
