## Big O: Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency

- The Big O analyzes efficiency based on two factors and they are running time and memory space.
- Quantifying run time is done by looking at time in milliseconds that it took to run a function from start to finish, the number of operations executed and the number of basic operations.
- Memory space is calculated by looking at the amount of space it takes to hold the code for the algorithm, I/O, and working space.
- Constant complexity means that whatever is thrown into an algorithm, it will always take up the same time and space.

## Linked Lists

- Linked lists can be singly and doubly. Singly means there is one reference to a node. Doubly means there is a double reference within the node.
- You are not able to use a foreach or for loop for traversal so we rely upon the next value in nodes.

## What’s a Linked List, Anyway pt1

- Linked lists are considered linear data structures.
- Linked lists don't store memory in one place, it can be scattered out. 
- Linked lists have the ability to shrink or grow. 

## What’s a Linked List, Anyway pt2

- When needing to insert data, linked lists work well but they are not efficient at searching for data.
- Traversal is a slow process within linked lists and can be pretty bad if you have a large data set.
