## Ethics in the workplace

I chose to read the article titled, "Microsoft and the DoD for the ethics in the workplace articles.
I disagree with the microsoft employees but I do see where they are coming from . Given that I am a veteran, I believe that it is in our best interest to give our soliders the best tools they can get. Doing so gives our soldiers the best chance of completing the mission. Most importantly, I would want our soldiers to have the best chance at returning home safely and if this technology aids in any way, then I do not oppose it. I do understand where the employees are coming from but at the end of the day we need to look out for the best interests of those soldiers who are defending their country. We should do everything in our power to make sure they come home safely. I do feel like the employees were not looking at it from a perspective like mine, where we put the best interests of our troops in mind.
What stuck out to me was the way the employees presented the problem as one going against the company's ideals.

## Ethics in Technology

I chose to read the Self Driving Car Ethics article. I don't really agree or disagree with the ethics of an autonomous car. I see myself as someone who could see benefits and downsides of having self-driving cars. I believe that there are a ton of bad drivers out there and in some of those cases, the self-driving car might be the safer option. At the same time, there is a lot of human error that can occur in code and the self-driving cars are going to be built with some computers that have code wrotten by humans. Given that human error, there could be a lot of trouble that brews as a result. The code had better be the most robust and error free code possible in order for it to be okay to use. I can see arguments for both sides. I do think that the car having to make hard decisions for someone can be controversial. I for one would like to be in control of my own driving and outcomes.
What stuck out to me were the examples provided in cases where the car would haveto make a decision on who to save.
