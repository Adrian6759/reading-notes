What are a few alternatives to AWS Amplify? What are the differences? What are the tradeoffs?
Alternatives to AWS amplify are Google firebase and Netlify but Amplify allows direct feature integration with AWSâ€™ powerful backend services. An upside to AWS is it quickly lets you add thigs like Storage, Authentication, Monitoring, and PubSub functionalities and it does it all without you hvaing to integrate any of it yourself. It all happens behind the scenes on the AWS end.
So one of the obvious pros to using Amplify helps save developers save time and focus more on the code itself. It also allows the developer to tear down the cloud components down quickly.

Some tradeoffs are that since you aren't learning what's going on behind the scenes, you're not really learning how to use use AWS.
Amplify is also not very geared towards collaboration, so if you want to collaborate it's probably not the best thing for you.
Amplify could also end up costing users if they are using paid services through Amplify by accident.
