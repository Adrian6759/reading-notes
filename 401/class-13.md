# Class Notes 13

- We need to make sure to have different names for each association resource when dealing with one-one relationships.
- One-to-one relationships are defined by using @OneToOne, one-to-many relationships are defined using the @OneToMany and @ManyToOne annotations.
- Many-to-many relationships are defined using the @ManyToMany annotation.
- Resources must be created before associations can be established.
- Integration tetsing is important because it verifies end-to-end behavior of a system.
- A limitation of MockMvc is that it may not support all the features of a full Spring application. It also makes no real connections during testing.
