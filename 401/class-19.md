# Class 19 Notes

- Purely functional programming ensures that all functions only depend on their arguments with no regard to global and state.
- The difference between pure and impure functional programming is that for pure functional programming, all common evaluation strategies produce the same result.
- Purely functional data structures have the attribute of being persisitent. It is required for functional programming.
- Purely functional data structures are able to be used in non functional languages but that isn't an efficicent use of them.
- Purely functional language only allows purely functional programming but that does not apply the other way around. Purely functional programs do not need to use purely functional language.

## Things I want to know more about

- In what situations are purely functional programs used? 
- What is an example of a purely functional language?
