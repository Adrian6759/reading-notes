# Class 27 Reading Notes

What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?
Shared Preferences reminds me of Hash sets because they are key value pairs. It also reminds me of PG Admin 4 because it contained a bunch of key value pairs.

Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.
Testing is important because it lets you know whether or not your methods are working. It also let's you know overall if your application is doing what it's supposed to.
Testing is a simple way to tell if you are on the right track.
Tesing allows us to evaluate our application in the places we specify. It allows us to get the confirmation and assurance.
Testing is important to me because it sets devs apart from one another, the ones who can write tests, andthe ones who can't.

Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.
The back stack is kind of like walking through a hallway of doors and the doors you open reveal a new current room. There is only one way in and one way out. In order to get back you need to shut the door of the room you were currently in and travel back to the previous room. This reminds me of the stack. It sounds like the exact same setup because stacks need to remove what's on top to be able to get to what's directly below it or even further below.
