- Your local machine will then send a request which may or may not be accepted if the right address cannot be located. If there is an error you will receive an error message to your local browser.
- The clinet and the server must receive acknowledgement of connection bewteen one another.
- An HTTP response is generated when a server receives a request,  processes it, and finds the resource that is being requested.
