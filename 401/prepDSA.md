# Data Structures and Algorithms

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
The Big O becuase it helps identify the most efficient algorithm.

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
We need to tell it when to start recursing. We can do this by having a separate base case and recursive case. The base case is what will keep it from going into an infinite loop.
