## Class 1 Reading Notes

*These are my notes about Markdown.*

Markdown is very useful when using markdown files on Github. It can be used to help make your webiste look nicer by being able to edit specific details in text or by allowing you to add images. Colors can be added and text can be formatted to fit the needs of the user according to their desired desing of the website.

The following are basic writing and formatting syntax.

- Headers are created by using a pound sign. # You can add up to six # signs to text. One # sign will give you the largest text while six will give you the smallest. You can any number of # signs between one and six in order to achieve the desired size you want.
- You can italicize text by putting * on both sides of the text you want italicized. There must be no spaces between the text and the *.
- You can make text bold by putting ** on both sides of the text you desire to be bold. There must be no spaces between the text and the **.
- You can strikethrough mistaken text by putting ~~ on both sides of the text. There must be no spaces between the text and the ~~
- You can make text both italicized and bold by putting *** on both sides of the text. There must be no spaces between the text and the ***. 
- Lists can be made by adding either a - or * to one or more lines of text.

These are only a few of the functions you can perform with markdown files.
