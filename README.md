**My reading journal for 102** ~~my reading journal for 101~~

Hello, my name is *Adrian Hernandez* and I am a new student at Code Fellows.

To me, growth mindset is accepting that there is always something new to learn. No one will ever be all knowing so they must learn and experience new things in order to grow and to not remain stagnant.

***Three reminders to stay in a growth mindset.***

1. Even the slightest improvement is a move in the right direction. 
2. Failure is still progress if you are continually moving in the direction of success.
3. Don't beat yourself up, even experts don't know all there is to know.
