# Class 9 Notes

### HTML Forms

1. Why are forms so important in web development?
Forms are important because they allow user interaction between them and the website. They also allow us to pull information from that user and store it as well for immediate use or eventual use.

2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?
It's always good to have a general idea of what you are going to be doing. Plan out what it is you want to do and how it is that you are going to accomplish it. Another thing is to not overly complicate things. You want that user experience to be the least stressful it can be.

3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.
form - A container element that stores forms
label - Label refers to one of three corresponding text fields, textarea being one of them.
input - A form control that is assists in creating teaxt fields
textarea - Data entry portion that receives all of the text.
button- A clickable element that allows the user to click on it when they are ready to send over data.

### Learn JS

1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?
An event is something that happens and in turn the system informs you about them so you can do something when those events occur.

2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?
We need the name of the event that we want to link it to and the code that will be run after it receives the prompt.

3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?
Event objects are events that are tied to event handler functions in order to give them more functionality. It is so useful because they can target events easily and are also really easy to remember.

4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?
In the capturing event, the browser looks for the outermost ancestor whereas bubbling looks for the direct parent of an element.
