### Learn CSS - Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.
-This means that flexbox is very limited on what it can do. Flexbox has very few functions it can carry out and it serves only one purpose and that is to display content with very limited capabilities.

2. Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis.
The main axis moves from left to right or right to left depedning on the flex direction and can go along a column or row.
The cross axis runs vertically up to down or down to up depending on the flex direction. 

3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?
Properties like reverse can impact accessibility when a screen reader is being used. The visual order can be different from whats being read because the reverse property goes in order of logic and not whats on the screen.
