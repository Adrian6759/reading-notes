# Class 10 Notes

This topic is important becuase we are constantly troubleshooting. As software development students we make a lot of mistakes because a lot of trial and error. Debugging and troubleshooting are imperative to our field.

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
-Syntax errors are usually just spelling errors that affect your code. They are usually easy to fix. A logic error is when your code is not running correcltly because the code itself is written wrong.They don't always have an error message with them so they can be harder to identify therefore making it more difficult to solve.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them. 
-This past lab I had both syntax and logic errors. Some of the variables I had defined had the letters s at the end of them and I had forgotten to include the s on some of them. This caused an error and I was able to fix it. I also kept putting commas into for loops instead of semicolons.
-I also encountered a few logic errors but the one I can specifically think of was using the wrong word to carry out the right function.

3.How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
-This will definitely make me more aware of common mistakes and I can start constructing ways to avoid errors the best that I can. I will make sure to attend to the red marks in my code that are yelling at me. Knowing common errors is the best way to start avoiding them because we'll know what not to do.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
The debugger tool is a handy way to identify what it is that you're doing wrong. It also tells you more or less if you're doing stuff right if you're not seeing any error messages. It allows you to see where it is that a problem is occuring or might be occuring. It will show you specific parts of your code and identify those that are giving you issues.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.
A breakpoint is a break in your code that stops soemething from happening immediately after and allows you to identify any problems present in your code.

3. What is the call stack?
The call stack is a part of the debugger that tells you what functions were carried out up until the breakpoint.
