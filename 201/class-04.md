### Miscellaneous

1.Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits 
 could help you on your coding journey.
 Greater efficiency would be very helpful on my journey. Having another set of eyes is always useful and can help me see errors that I woulnd't notice right away. It not only saves time but it allows more time to focus on bigger issues during projects. Since some jobs do this it would give me a good understanding of how it is to work with a partner and being able to take on one or both roles.

 Work enviroment readiness would also be very beneficial. Having a leg up on the competition is something that is very appealing to me. There are other people competing for the same job that maybe be applying with CSE Bacheolor's Degrees that look very good on paper btu who don't have the experiences we get at Code Fellows to be able to operate in a work enviroment right off the bat.
