# Class 7 Notes

This topic is important because it shows us different ways of using pages. COnstructors are important because they can sometimes make coding a little easier. 

### Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.
- We need domain modeling because it is such an important communication tool that allows various teams to be able to efficiently identify problems. The more understanding you have about a problem, the better you are able to tackle it.

### HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
- Tables should not be used for page layouts because they are much harder to style and can cause a number of issues. They are make it difficult for visually imparied individuals to interpret the content within them.

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
- td- Table Cell: The smallest element of a table that contains general content.
tr- Table Row: Used to stop a list of table cells to differentiate them from other lists.
th- Table Header: Used to identify the overall theme or relatedness of the contents of the table cells.

### Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
- A constructor is a function that creates new objects. Some advantages to it are that it can save you time if you are going to be using the same object over and over. It will also make the code cleaner.

2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
- In an object literal, this is binded to properties and methods within itself but with a constructor, it binds to the new object.

### Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
- Prototypes are kind of like DOD IDs. Every soldier has one and it is tied to them, just like every function has a prototype assigned to it.
- Inhertitance can be kind of like going to the central issue facility. All soldiers go there to receive old gear that was used by previous soldiers. Sometimes you are given the ability to add new gear just like methods can be inherited in javascript.
