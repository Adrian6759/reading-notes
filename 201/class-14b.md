* In the beginning, the article highlights Julia Rososky and her earlier life while she was attending Yale. It tells us about how she got along better with her chosen study group vs her assigned group. 
* Google wanted to optimize the performance of their teams to find out what made teams perform well. Because of this they created Project Aristotle. Rozosky worked on Project Aristotle.

* The researchers found that collective intelligence was more important than the individual intelligence of individual members. They also found that if the individuals of a team all get the same amount of time to speak, it reflects postively. Another finding they had was that more successful teams had members who were able to identify the feelings of others in the group. In other words, the better teammates were those who were more sensitive to others. Teams with better norms are going to be more successful.

* Psychologically safe environments are the best enviroments to work in according to the article. This is an environment where individuals feel good about speaking freely and not recieving scrutiny from others. Being able to bond with other members in your group will make one another more understanding of each others situations and will create a better team dynamic.
