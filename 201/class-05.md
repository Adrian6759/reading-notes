# Class 5 Notes

### HTML Media
Using Images In HTML. Read Common Image Types and Choosing Image Formats.

1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?
The reason it is used in a website is for the instances where the image doesn't load, there is an alternative, this being a description of the image that lets you know what should be there.

2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?
You can improve accessibility of images in an HTML document by usign a separate images folder to store images that you will later on have the option to link in an HTML.

3. Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.
When you have multiple images and captions, figures can hold them easily.

4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.
A gif is a short snippet of an animated image, kinda like them cartoons you used to watch... you know like Steamboat Willy but it only lasts a few seconds. And an svg is the same thing as the little icons you see on your grandson's fancy computer. You don't know what an icon is? Well how about the paramount symbol you used to see in the movies you used to like. The still shot of the image could be considered an svg.

5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?
PNG would probably be a good image type for a website. It's good for capturing text in a screenshot. Other methods might leave the text looking out of focus.

### Learn CSS

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
If you were to have two pieces of colored paper, let's say a blue and a green piece of paper. If you were to put the blue piece of paper behind the green piece of paper, it would be the background color. The green piece of paper would then be the foreground color. If you were to switch their positioning, the roles would reverse. Imagine seeing this on a screen. The blue piece of paper is the background and the green piece of paper is the foreground but the green piece is smaller than the blue one. You would be able to see some of the background but whatever the green was blocking would be the foreground.

2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?
Add a css file to the web folder and link it to the html. I would use color to edit the text of his website. I would also change the background color to make it look a little more lively.

3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?
You want to make sure that they are web safe fonts.

4. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?
font-size changes the actual size of the text, font-weight can control how bold text is, and font-style will control whether or not italics are turned on or off.

5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.
You can either use letter-spacing or word-spacing to set space between either text or words in the h1 element.
