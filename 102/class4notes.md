## Class 4 Notes

Wireframe- Practice in which designers are able to build the structure of a project they are working on. It allows them to layout what they would like to build prior to using all their resources from the beginning. It is a cost effective way to get a project started. Software such as Invision can be used to create a digital wireframe. A very cost effective method is using a pencil and paper to build that framework. It allows the participants the ability to make quick and easy changes on the spot. There are many way to do this but it is important to first understand who your audience is. Determine what will make the user experience the best and make it user friendly. Once you’ve built a good enough wireframe, you can make your prototype.

HTML is Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the markup language that defines the structure of your content.
HTML Element consists of an opening and closing tag and content. That content can be modified depending on what types of tags are applied.

Things an HTML Document should always contain.
* `<!DOCTYPE html>`— doctype. 
Required at the beginning of the document. Needed to make sure your document behaves correctly. 
* `<html></html>` — the `<html>`element. 
Wraps all the content on the entire page.
* `<head></head>` — the `<head>` element. 
Acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. .
* `<title></title>` — the `<title>` element. 
Sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab.
* `<body></body>` — the `<body>` element. 
Contains all the content that you want to show to web users.
