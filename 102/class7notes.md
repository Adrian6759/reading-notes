Control Flow
*order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
*Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

*A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
*The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas: function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3)
*The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:
*When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
Benefits of Using Functions
*You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
*You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.
